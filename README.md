This is very buggy and incomplete as there aren't many cases added.  
*if you want to contribute just make a new extension folder in vs-code after installing NODE.js and **"npm install -g yo generator-code"** in the folder terminal in vs-code or just search on "how to create Extension folder in vscode"*  
*After that select the **typescript** template and replace the package.json and extension.ts in the respective directories from my repo*
